***MEDICAL CLINIC APP***

An application created using Android Studio, Java and Firebase DB to serve patients and doctors at a medical clinic. Patients are able to sign up/log in to book appointments, view upcoming appointments and view available doctors. Doctors are able to log in to view upcoming appointments, patient history and their availability.

This project was created by a team of 4 using Scrum. I was Scrum Master throughout a two week period where we had to complete the following 10 user stories:

**Patient:**

As a patient I want to see my upcoming appointments so that I can get information of the upcoming appointments.

As a patient I want to see a "book appointment" button so that I can see a list of doctors.

As a patient I want to see the availability of the selected doctor so that I book an appointment.

As a patient I want to have a filter so that I can filter on doctors' gender and specialization when book an appointment.

**Doctor:**

As a doctor I want to see my upcoming appointments so that I can get information of the upcoming appointments.

As a doctor I want to inspect the patients so that I can see their medical information, along with a list of previous doctors this patient has seen.

As a doctor I want to view my own schedule so that I can see which patients have booked for what time slots, as well as which time slots are still available.
